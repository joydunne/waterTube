# ezGraph
A simple class to making graphing using matplotlib easier for my python students.


MODEL: Something that imitates another closely that can perdict the future. 
    A represent of the real word. 
         --- requires some data about the real world.
     -  analytical model: Equation or function that represents or best fits the data. 
         -- linear, polynomial, exponential, sinusodal, logarithmic, hyperbolic, radical. 
         -- plug in a input and the equation gives the output
             --- h (t) = 2 t + 7 
             --- input = t 
             --- output = h 
         - only works for well behaved systems. Not a whole lot of interactions that introduce errors. Non-chaotic. 
         - often calculus to find equations. 
     - physical models: 
         -- small scale physical things (you can touch it)
         -- can be more complex 
         -- problems with scalling (you have to make sure it is accurate)
     - numerical models:
         -- usually computer models because there's a lot of calculations (algebraic)
         -- usually break the system into smaller parts that interact with each other. 
         -- the computer is used to keep track of all the interactions. 
         -- we'll focus on things that CHANG OVER TIME. And focus on FINITE DIFFERENCE models (finite means not infinite).
